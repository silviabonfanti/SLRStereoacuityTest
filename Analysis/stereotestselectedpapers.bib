  abstract        = {Background: To determine the stereoacuity threshold with a 3D laptop equipped with 3D shutter glasses, and to evaluate the effect of different shape and size of test symbols and different type of disparities to stereoacuity.
Methods: Thirty subjects with a visual acuity in each eye of at least 0 logMAR and a stereoacuity of at least 32 arcsec (as assessed in Fly Stereo Acuity Test) were recruited. Three target symbols—tumbling "E", tumbling "C", and "□"—were displayed, each with six different sizes representing a visual acuity ranging from 0.5 to 0 logMAR when tested at 4.1 m, and with both crossed and uncrossed disparities. Two test systems were designed - fixed distance of 4.1 m and one for variable distance. The former has disparities ranging from 10 to 1000 arcsec. Each subject completed 36 trials to investigate the effect of different symbol sizes and shapes, and disparity types on stereoacuity. In the variable distance system, each subject was tested 12 times for the same purposes, both proximally and distally (the point where the 3D effect just appears and where it just disappears respectively), and the mean value was calculated from the mean proximal and distal distances.
Results: No significant difference was found among the groups in the fixed distance test system (Kruskal-Wallis test; Chi-square = 29.844, P = 0.715). Similarly, no significant difference was found in the variable distance system (Kruskal-Wallis test; proximal: Chi-square = 5.687, P = 0.338; distal: Chi-square = 5.898, P = 0.316; mean: Chi-square = 6.152, P = 0.292).
Conclusions: Evaluating stereoacuity using this measurement system was convenient and effective. Changes in target shape and size and disparity types had no significant effect on stereoacuity. It would be helpful to choose optimal targets according to different purposes using computer-assisted 3D measurements.},

  abstract        = {Purpose
To evaluate the test-retest reliability and validity of the new automated computerized distance visual acuity and stereoacuity test for children, which uses an interactive video game.
Design
Retrospective, observational case series.
Methods
A total of 102 children aged between 3 and 7 years underwent the Snellen visual acuity test, the Distance Randot Stereotest, and the new automated computerized distance visual acuity and stereoacuity test. The test-retest reliability and validity of the automated computerized tests were assessed and compared with the Snellen visual acuity test and the Distance Randot Stereotest with frequency distributions of the differences, Bland-Altman plots, and Deming regression.
Results
The automated computerized distance visual acuity test had high test-retest reliability (95% limits of agreement ±0.18 logMAR, 90.0% of the differences within 0.2 logMAR) and acceptable validity as compared with the Snellen visual acuity chart (95% limits of agreement ±0.27 logMAR, 81.3% of the differences within 0.2 logMAR). The automated computerized distance stereoacuity test had high test-retest reliability (95% limits of agreement ±0.29 log arc second, 95.1% of the differences within 0.3 log arc second) and acceptable validity as compared with the Distance Randot Stereotest (95% limits of agreement ±0.35 log arc second, 93.9% of the differences within 0.3 log arc second).
Conclusions
The new automated computerized distance visual acuity and stereoacuity test, which uses an interactive video game, has good reliability and acceptable validity compared with the Snellen visual acuity chart and the Distance Randot Stereotest.},
